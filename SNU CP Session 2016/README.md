# SNU Competitive Programming Session #1 2016
Held on 22nd August 2016, this competitive session is to break the ice of my juniors w.r.t. the trend of CP.
So, I have solved these questions prior to volunteering in this session.
Coding compiler - GNU GCC 4.9.2


P.S. To everyone for whom this session is intended, please don't copy this code. Use it for your understanding and try to solve the problem yourself. It'll definitely help you in the future.
